## Exercise - Variables
 
 Declare a variable `schooling` and set it to the number of years of school that you have completed. Print `schooling` to the console.

var schooling: Int = 12

//:  Now imagine you just completed an additional year of school, and update the `schooling` variable accordingly. Print `schooling` to the console.
print(schooling+1)

//:  Does the above code compile? Why is this different than trying to update a constant? Print your explanation to the console using the `print` function.
print("Because we are using a variable, we can change its value. If we used a constant, we would get an error because we cannot change the value of a constant once it is initialized.")
